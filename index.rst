OpenVXML Without Tears
==========================

:Authors: Vikram Ramanarayanan and Eugene Tsuprun (with inputs from the OpenVXML Setup and User Guides)

Overview
-----------

In this manual, you will learn how to:

- Install Eclipse and the OpenVXML plugin for Eclipse
- Create a callflow for a "Hello world" voice application
- Deploy an application
- Use halefBot to test out the application
- Use `autoggs.py` to add logging and semantic categorization capabilities

Eclipse is an IDE (interactive development environment) that will allow you, among other things, to design call workflows compatible with Halef.
