OpenVXML Without Tears
==========================

:Authors: Vikram Ramanarayanan and Eugene Tsuprun (with inputs from the OpenVXML Setup and User Guides)

Overview
-----------

In this manual, you will learn how to:

- Install Eclipse and the OpenVXML plugin for Eclipse
- Create a callflow for a "Hello world" voice application
- Deploy an application
- Use halefBot to test out the application
- Use `autoggs.py` to add logging and semantic categorization capabilities

Installing Eclipse and OpenVXML
--------------------------------

Eclipse is an IDE (interactive development environment) that will allow you, among other things, to design call workflows compatible with Halef.

Install Java Development Kit 8.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`JDK 8`_ is a prerequisite for Eclipse and OpenVXML. Here is the direct link to the `Windows 64-bit version`_.

Install Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and install Eclipse_. Do not use the latest version--only this one.

Install the OpenVXML plug-in for Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start Eclipse.

From the menu, select *Help* â†’ *Install New Software...*.

In the Install dialog that appears, in the "Work with:" field at the top, add the VTP's update site: http://build.openmethods.com/downloads/OpenVXML5.0/repository/ and hit Enter.

Check the `OpenVXML 5.0` as well as the `Uncategorized packages` at the top and click Next. Note that this part takes a little while.
